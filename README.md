#### My day work
> Senior software engineer for enterprise-grade mobile applications

For many years now I have been developing apps for iOS and iPadOS together with my colleagues at [anfema](https://anfe.ma) which help our international customers to digitalize their internal processes, to be free of errors and to enable their employees to be more productive but also to have more fun at work. 

Developing software is much more than just typing lines in the computer. It's conception, architecture, consulting and then maybe some typing. I love the creativity which I can actively live out day in and day out.

But may you ask, why are there just a few Swift reposistories? Because I like doing my open work in contexts' that are new to me and in which I'm confident that I do not break any licenses with my employeers.

#### My communities
> I contribute to one of the biggest Microsoft news portals drwindows.de. In the past I wrote for mobilegeeks.de, apfeltalk.de and many more

I love communities! Ever since I got access to an internet modem, I've been participating in communities around the globe. After working for MobileGeeks, [Apfeltalk](https://apfeltalk.de) and [RadioTux](https://radiotux.de), I've been a permanent member of the [Dr. Windows](https://drwindows.de) team for several years now, where I usually take care of reporting on developer-specific topics. Besides the novelties themselves, I also try to introduce newcomers to the exciting field of software development through my articles.

> I'm a stutterer that suffers from a chronical desease calld multiple sclerosis - let's talk about it!

For many years I was not ashamed of any illness or my speech impediment and I hid it. Since my thirtieth year, I have made the decision to stop and just actively deal with the issue and on social media as well as [YouTube](https://youtube.com/@tscholze) under the name "The Stuttering Nerd" for this to create awarness and to try to break down inhibitions.
